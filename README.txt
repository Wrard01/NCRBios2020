#######   NCR BIOS CREATOR BY Mel    ######


This program offers a simple way to generate USB Bios sticks for different models of the NCR POS Systems. 



The first thing to keep in mind is that this process may erase the content of the USB Drive selected in the drives
list and the information will be hard or impossible to recover. Second, use this under your own risk as this is
a tool for internal use and for people with knowledge of the NCR Products and versions.



To create a USB Drive bios first connect the USB drive you want to use as the USB bootable Bios and unplug all 
the other USB drives to avoid any accidental data deletion, if more than one USB drive is connected the program 
will detect all the removable devices, make sure you have selected the right one from the list. once the USB drive
 is selected pick the target model, to display all the available models click on the arrow pointing down and click
 on the Set Bios Button, a message will show which USB drive has been overwritten and what terminal the bios is for. 


If more than one USB needs to be create connect a different USB Drive a click om refresh Button, if no USB is 
connected before running the program and error message will show click ok and connect the USB you want to use and click on Refresh.



There are two ways to close this program first one is by clicking on the Close button or click on the X on the right side of the form.
